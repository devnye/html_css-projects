    <h1>How to be successful in this course</h1>
    <p>
      Taking an online course can be overwhelming. How do you learn at your own
      pace and successfully achieve your goals?
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        Here are some general tips that can help you stay focused and on track.
      </p>

      <h2>Set daily goals for studying</h2>
      <p>
        Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish in your course each day.
        Setting a clear goal can help you stay motivated and beat
        procrastination. The goal should be specific and easy to measure, such
        as "I’ll watch all the videos in Module 2 and complete the first
        programming assignment". And don’t forget to reward yourself when you
        make progress towards your goal!
      </p>
      <h2>Create a dedicated study space</h2>
      <p>
        It’s easier to recall information if you’re in the same place where you
        first learned it, so having a dedicated space at home to take online
        courses can make your learning more effective. Remove any distractions
        from the space and if possible, make it separate from your bed or sofa.
        A clear distinction between where you study and where you take breaks
        can help you focus. 
      </p>
      <h2>Schedule time to study on your calendar</h2>
      <p>
        Open your calendar and choose a predictable, reliable time that you can
        dedicate to watching lectures and completing assignments. This helps
        ensure that your courses won’t become the last thing on your to-do list.
        Tip: You can add deadlines for a Coursera course to your Google
        calendar, Apple calendar, or another calendar app.
      </p>
      <h2>Keep yourself accountable</h2>
      <p>
        Tell your friends about the courses you’re taking, post achievements to
        your social media accounts or blog about your homework assignments.
        Having a community and support network of friends and family to cheer
        you on makes a difference!
      </p>
      <h2>Actively take notes</h2>
      <p>
        Taking notes can promote active thinking, boost comprehension and extend
        your attention span. It’s a good strategy to internalize knowledge
        whether you’re learning online or in the classroom. So, grab a notebook
        or find a digital app that works best for you and start synthesizing key
        points.

          >Tip: While watching a lecture on Coursera, you can click the 'Save
          Note' button below the video to save a screenshot to your course notes
          and add your own comments.</em
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Join the discussion</h2>
      <p>
        Course discussion forums are a great place to ask questions about
        assignments, discuss topics, share resources and make friends. Our
        research shows that learners who participate in the discussion forums
        are 37% more likely to complete a course. So make a post today!
      </p>
      <h2>Do one thing at a time</h2>
      <p>
        Multitasking is less productive than focusing on a single task at a
        time. Researchers from Stanford University found that “People who are
        regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information
        cannot pay attention, recall information or switch from one job to
        another as well as those who complete one task at a time.” Stay focused
        on one thing at a time. You’ll absorb more information and complete
        assignments with greater productivity and ease than if you were trying
        to do many things at once.
      </p>
      <h2>Take breaks</h2>
      <p>
        Resting your brain after learning is critical to high performance. If
        you find yourself working on a challenging problem without much progress
        for an hour, take a break. Walking outside, taking a shower or talking
        with a friend can help you to re-energize and even give you new ideas on
        how to tackle the project.

      <h2>Your learning journey starts now!</h2>
      <p>
        While preparing for the module quiz or working on achieving your
        learning goals you're encouraged to:
      </p>
      <ul>
         
        <li>
          Work through each lesson in the learning pathway. Try not to skip any
          activities or lessons unless you are certain that you already know
          this information well enough to move ahead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the opportunity to go back and watch a video or read all the
          information provided before moving on to the next lesson or module.
        </li>
        <li>Complete all the knowledge and module quizzes and exercises.</li>
        <li>
          Read the feedback carefully when answering quizzes, as this will help
          you to reinforce what you are learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make use of the practical learning environment provided by the
          exercises. You can gain substantial reinforcement of your learning
          through the step-by-step application of your skills.
        </li>
      </ul>
